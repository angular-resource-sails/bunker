TEXT FORMATTING


You can format the text of room messages by wrapping text in special characters:

italics 		_text_   - enclose text with "_" to make the text italic
bold   			*text*   - enclose text with "*" to make the text bold
spoilers		|text| 	 - enclose text with "|" to hide it from others
strikethrough	~text~   - enclose text with "~" to make the text strikethrough

UPLOADING IMAGES

There are two ways to upload an image into a room:

1. Drag and Drop

You can drag and drop an image from your computer into a Bunker room. A preview of the
image will be displayed, and then you can confirm to upload the image. The image is
then uploaded to imgur.com, and the Url to the image (once upload to imgur is complete)
is provided in the chat message box. Finally, just press enter or Send to post the image
Url to the room.

2. Copy and Paste

If you have an image in your computer's copy buffer (e.g. copy from Chrome, or from an image
editing program), you can simply paste it into the chat message box. Then follow the same steps
as with Drag and Drop to confirm the image upload and posting.
